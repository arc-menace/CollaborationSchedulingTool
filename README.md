# CollaborationSchedulingTool

Helps students get together for studying in classes

## What we need to work on

- A way store schedules for classes (MongoDB, AWS, Azure)
- Need user accounts
  - Name
  - Classes they are in
  - Events they want to see
  - Times they usually are available to study
  - Ability to link to calendar and add events
  - A bitmoji like avatar or face feature (no pictures)
  - If it knows location, it can ask users to verify building/study rooms
    - Options to update location at varying frequencies (or never)
- Ability to provide location by building (e.g. I'm in the library studying for _____)
- Code to automatically create study events people can join
- Provide reminders in a feed for assignments
- Allow user to join study sessions
  - Study session can provide options for locations that suit the size of the group
    - Maybe also suggest local coffee shops
- Ability for users to create their own events
  - Manually set their location and set how long they will be there and what classes/assignments they will be working on
  - Ability to live check into (in the case that you just kind of stumble upon it)
  - Ability to set rooms
    - Or custom summary/location/description
- Shows different buildings (which users can select which ones to see) and when people who are in your classes are in those buildings
  - Users can select whether their name is shown when they are at a location or just a number (like Joe and 2 others are in the Engineering Building
- Hidden Achievements? Maybe unlock the tab whenever you first host a study session
- Titles/verified users who can create locations and study areas
- Map functionality which uses the location of the user to find coffee shops (maybe have ads...)

- Need to start designing the interface
